# deceptive-speech
ML for classifying deceptive speech from audio/text 

## Notes:

- We should run experiments with nested stratified cross validation (say 5 outer and 3 inner folds)
- The naive baseline is 53%?
- The current baseline is 66%?

## TODO:

- [ ] Logistic Regression w/
- [ ] L1 regularization
- [ ] L2 regularization
- [ ] Grouped LASSO -- we should discuss what groupings make sense
- [ ] Random Forest
- [ ] Neural Sequence model
- [ ] Maybe do some simple dimension reduction in preprocessing w/ Chi Square or PCA?
